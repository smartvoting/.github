## Project Description

The Smart Voting platform is a secure web application that allows for elections to be held digitally, all while ensuring the integrity of the ballots. Smart Voting utilizes a ledger database to securely and transparently keep track of votes as they are cast. As with all elections, ballots must be anonymous, but valid. This means checks must be done to make sure the voter is legally authorized to cast a ballot. Additionally, election officials and parties want to know as much data as possible about how and where people voted. There are various unique tools built into the system to assist with interpreting this data. Some of these tools will be publicly available and others will only be accessible by election officials and parties.

## Organization Repositories

Currently, all repositories have been set to private. Upon completion of the Capstone Project, the repositories will be set to public. This will allow prospective employers to view our group's work.

## Technical Details

For the technology stack, we are mainly using the Amazon Web Services ecosystem.
